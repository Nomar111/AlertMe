# AlertMe
AlertMe ~~is~~ was a World of Warcraft Classic addon, mainly directed towards PvP.

The project has long been abandoned, but i am happy to share the code. 

Please keep in mind that this was my first and last (and only) lua coding project that i ever worked on. 

From "Hello-World" to an extensive addon in one go - what a wild and unexpected ride that was!

For the Horde!
